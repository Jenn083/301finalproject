<p>New Health Inspection grades based on Updated Data from King County:
http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/environmental-health/food-safety/inspection-system/food-safety-rating.aspx</p>
<p> We decided to adopt this as our rubric for grading the health inspection scores of
different restaurants</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>As an elderly citizen, I want to find a place where I won’t get food poisoning since I have a weak immune system.</p>
<p>As a 30 something professional, I want to eat somewhere that is not only good but clean. I would like to find information on this via a user-friendly app that will aid me in my quest to eat clean around Seattle. The app must be visually appealing.</p>
<p>As a cockroach, I want to find a restaurant with the most red flags, so I can eat with my friends.</p>
<p>As a developer, I want to ensure that we have a smooth integration for fast uploads.</p>
<p>As a child of the 80’s, I need to hear some incarnation of the Inspector Gadget theme song.
